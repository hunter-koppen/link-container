## LinkContainer
Create a container as an anchor (/<a>) element including a link. This will allow you to for example allow links to be opened with ctrl+click or middlemousebutton.

## Features
- Render your Mendix content inside a link container.

## Usage
Simply add the widget to the page and setup the url you wish to allow on click. Next you can add any content your want inside the container.

If you add text inside the container this text will automatically show up as an actual link.

This way you can implement the use of actual urls which enables opening a link with ctrl+click or rightclick -> open in new tab for example.
